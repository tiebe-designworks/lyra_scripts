# Lyra scripts
Here are some of the scripts and functions we use in Lyra - open-source and free for you to use.

Note: We use discord.py 1.3.0a for Lyra, so we recommend you do the same.

## instance_picker
Allows users to run functions ("modules") on a specific instance they pick stored in a central database.
